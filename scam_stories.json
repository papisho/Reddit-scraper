        "text": "Let me try this again. My previous title was junk :)\n\nJust posting this here for visibility/feedback, perhaps some people are more familiar with how this scam works? I can tell you that this guy would most likely have fooled my Parents (Both in their 70's) if he called them. The amount of data he had was convincing.\n\nSome Guy called me claiming to be \"my bank\", and my account had a security alert placed on it. He spoofed the Phone number of A Bank for the call (Which was Different from my bank that he was claiming to be from.) Weirdly, my phone rang twice. Once with the number showing '+1-800-735-8571', which I answered, and it instantly hung up, and then immediately thereafter with '+8007358571'. The second one is what it showed for the whole call\n\nWhat really surprised me was all the information he had. He had my Name, Address, Phone number, Email address, who I banked with, and the first SIX digits of my Credit Card number of the account that was 'supposedly compromised'. He told me all of this under 'verification'.. like \"Is your address still...\" \"Is your email address still...\" etc. I asked him for the last 4 digits, but he said he 'wasn't allowed' to provide those, lol.\n\nI pretty much knew it was a scam from the start, but I played along, not giving him anything, to try and find out everything he had (with the goal of figuring out where he got it from, and what he had so I could cancel/reset/etc that immediately thereafter).\n\nHe wanted me to change my password for my bank immediately, He was SUPER insistent on doing it right then Which got me worried that he somehow could see my screen or login or something, but I ran malware checkers and no sort of backdoor monitoring was found.\n\nRegardless, I told him that I had 2FA enabled on that login, and didn't see any attempts come through, so I wasn't going to reset it right now. I'm guessing after I changed it, he would have asked me for the new one or something.. I dunno. He abandoned that pretty quickly when I told him I'd do it later.\n\nEventually I told him 'Lets just cancel that card then, if its been compromised'. At that point he asked me for the last 4 of my SSN and my mother's maiden name, so I asked him for his extension number so I can call him back through my Bank's main number to provide secure information like that. He said some bullshit about needing to call him back on a personal line, to which I told him to go fuck himself, and hung up.\n\nFrom the data he had, It seems like some e-commerce site I shopped at somewhere, sometime, might have gotten compromised. He had everything that would have been on a typical 'Checkout' page for a website. Name, Email, Phone (He called me), Address, and some credit card information.\n\nI immediately called my (ACTUAL) bank, and cancelled the card he referred to, informed them of the scam attempt, and reset my passwords, which I already have 2FA on, but just to be sure.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI live in Germany and this is happening with a German \u201ccompany\u201d. \n\nI run several Faceless TikTok accounts to earn some extra money. I have now received a cooperation request on one of the accounts for the first time. It's about an app. I'm supposed to keep posting my content and then incorporate the app. For every video in which I promote the app, I receive the following remuneration, according to the contract: \n\n5,000 views: \u20ac10\n\n10,000 views: 20 \u20ac\n\n50,000 views: 50 \u20ac\n\n100,000 views: 150 \u20ac\n\n1,000,000 views: 300 \u20ac\n\nThe remuneration is not outstanding, but I get an average of 50-150k views, so it can be worth it. However, I'm a bit afraid of falling for a scam. \n\nThe app I'm talking about does exist. There is also a website for it and the UG mentioned in the legal notice is also entered in the commercial register. The managing director is also mentioned by name, but I couldn't really find out much. The UG has only been in existence since January 15, 2025. \n\nI was also sent the contract via Google Docs. The contract is not the kind of contract you would expect from an employer, but there are no suspicious-looking clauses or anything recognizable. \n\nSo far, I've only sent one of my trash mails (to send the contract). In order to finalize the contract, he now wants my personal data and also my Apple ID so that he can give me 100% premium access.\n\nPayment would be made via Paypal, I will issue invoices as soon as I want a payout (contractually regulated)\n\nDo you have any ideas on how I could be scammed here or what I should look out for? Is this a normal procedure for cooperations?\n\n",

        "text": "My mom has been a victim of multiple romance scams for months, possibly close to a year, believing she\u2019s in a relationship with \"Jason Momoa\" and that \"Elon Musk\" is going to send her money. No matter how much my family tries to convince her that it\u2019s fake, she refuses to listen. I believe she was targeted through Instagram, where she follows many Jason Momoa fan accounts. Scammers likely messaged her there and convinced her to download Telegram, where she now talks to them regularly. She shares personal information, including details about me and other family members, as well as her ID and our home address. At one point, someone even sent her a fake check in the mail, which she tried to cash.\n\nHer belief in these scams has caused serious damage to our family. My parents\u2019 relationship was already rocky due to past issues, my dad may have cheated on my mom. I'm not sure if he did but from messages I was able to read when snooping through my moms phone that's what I can see. (I know it's not right to snoop through peoples phones, especially parents but it's come down to this.). My mom is obviously hurt and not in a good place mentally and I think she is finding comfort in these scammers. She insists that she has met \"Jason Momoa\" in person but has no proof, saying he\u2019s currently in a hospital in Toronto. When I showed her that the real Jason Momoa is publicly dating Adria and filming movies, she got defensive. She even played me a voice message from \"Jason\" that was clearly AI-generated,it was robotic, fast-paced, and obviously scripted but she refused to accept that it wasn\u2019t real and got angry.\n\nShe has also canceled important family plans because of this. My older sister planned for her daughters to see our mom, but she refused to come unless she could bring \"Jason.\" My sister, knowing this was a lie, refused because the request was bizarre but also because our mom is still married to our dad and my nieces are all below the age of 7 so she was worried what message this would send them.\n\nMy sisters and I are considering staging an intervention, and I plan to report everything to the police. However, I need to gather more information from her phone first, which may take time.   \n  \nIs there everything else me and my sisters can do in this situation in legal terms? My entire family is suffering from this and especially me as I'm the youngest one (19f) of my sisters who is still living with both my parents so I'm the one who has to hear this all the time.",

Five minutes later I started getting spam text messages from bogus emails that looked like fake promotional signups.
